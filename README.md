 Crypto Spread Logger & Live Trade Monitor

This project is a Python-based framework for monitoring live crypto trades across multiple exchanges, logging spreads, and supporting further research into high-frequency trading strategies.  

It is structured to be modular, with separate components for market data feeds, spread monitoring, utilities, and visualization.
